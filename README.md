# What is it

It's my new personal site for Github Pages service. Also simple static blog is added.
It was developed in [new-github-pages repo](https://github.com/nek-ra/new-github-pages). Basic version is finished and now arriving to [nek-ra.github.io](https://nek-ra.github.io)

# What used

Here used [Nuxt.JS](https://nuxtjs.org/) with it's module [@nuxt/content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/).

Nuxt Content module is used for easier project's info updating and also is used to create a blog section.

Disqus service is used to provide comments at blog, because Github Pages host a static sites only. Otherwise you can start discussions at [repo's discussions](https://github.com/NEK-RA/nek-ra.github.io/discussions)
