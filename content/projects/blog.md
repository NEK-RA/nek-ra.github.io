## Where?
Here I'm talking about [blog section](/blog) at this site. 

## How?
This blog is built with **Nuxt Content** module, which allow me to write content in markdown files. As this site is generated with NuxtJS (Static Site Generation), I have no ability to add comments by myself. So for comments I used Disqus. It allows you to use your Disqus, Google, Facebook and Twitter profiles to leave a comment. As you understand, Disqus as external service use cookies with their own privacy policy. If you visit the [privacy section](/privacy), you will see notification about Disqus

## What is it about?
I can't say anything concrete now, cause I just want to have a place to write something. May be interesting, may be not. I've just learning for Vue and Nuxt to rewrite my personal page, but when I met **Nuxt Content**, I've understand that I want to use it on my personal page :D

## What's next?
My post template is not ideal and I will think about redesign it. Also I'll try to get free Disqus Plus for non-commercial personal blog. May be in future Disqus will be replaced with something similar. If you have ideas about how to improve post template, feel free to contact me and give your advices.
