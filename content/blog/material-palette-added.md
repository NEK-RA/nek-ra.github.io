I guess today is the shortest post ever in my blog 🤣

The app, mentioned in [previous post](https://nek-ra.github.io/blog/started-with-flutter#starting-point) now added to this site into the **Projects** section. It also was published to Google Play :D

In near future I will also release v1.1.0, where will be one more language and also builds for desktop platforms (windows, linux). 🤔

For now, visit the [Material Palette project's page](https://nek-ra.github.io/projects/material_palette) to see all info, and links to try it 😁

P.S.: for now all dependencies supports for Web, so you don't even need to download it to your device, just try in the browser 👌

P.P.S.: don't use grid view on wide screens 😅 it's not yet optimized for wide screens 😅
