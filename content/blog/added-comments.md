## Disqus comments

Hi there.

I never worked with Disqus, and I'm not sure if I need to configure something after adding "universal code" to post template.

Hope that's everything working as planned. Pushing to repo...

## Update

After some configurations comments now works properly. Glad to see that.

## Warning:

Currently this blog built and deployed with Vercel. Check if your address looks like ~~nek-ra.vercel.app~~

If yes, then this reminder for you: **Vercel used as easy to run deployment platform. In future I'll try to move everything into Github (Github Pages service using Github Actions CI/CD)**. I don't know when it will be, and I'm not sure that it will be possible to save all comments. Some posts also will be deleted. As result - some comments will be removed too.

## Update

I forgot to edit that when it was needed. Everything is already deploying to github pages by Github Actions continious deployment :)
