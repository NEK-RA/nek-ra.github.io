## Welcome

Today my new personal site is released. Time is going, and old personal page is not actual, not comfortable to update and etc.

Some time ago I've started with Vue.JS front-end framework and it's wonderfull. With VueMastery free week (spring of 2020) I've got enough info and at the end of 2020 I've got enough time to rebuild my personal page.

Now it's not a few manualy writen html files, now it's site generated with Nuxt.JS. Thanks to **@nuxt/content** module - now I have a small blog at my Github Pages site.

Yes, this site is not ideal now, there's enough places to improve, but I think I'll never rewrite this personal site again, at least not in near future :D
