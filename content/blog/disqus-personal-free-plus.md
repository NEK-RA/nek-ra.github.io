## No more ads in comments

Finaly I've got a *non-profit/personal blog free Plus subscription plan* for Disqus, and disabled ads in comments.

Getting free subscription is a simple task... Strange, long, but simple. 

First of all - you will not find an official guide for that. You just see the next at pricing page: 

> *"you can self identify for a free subscription to our Plus plan"* 

And now you're free to search ~~in google~~anywhere for details. While searching you can find [Disqus community](https://disqus.com/home/channel/discussdisqus/) with similar questions. Most of them has an answer with the same instruction from people with moderator labels ("Mod"). And these answers looks like:

>A good way to self-identify is to start a Plus trial and use the premium support during the trial to reach out to Disqus. They can then continue the plan without billing once the trial is over.

[My question](https://disqus.com/home/channel/discussdisqus/discussion/channel-discussdisqus/plans_and_pricing_how_long_is_process_of_self_identify/) in this place was left unanswered.

## My case

It was 10th of January, when I decided to try this way. I've activated trial Plus and tried to contact [support](https://disqus.com/support/) (section "Can't find what you're looking for?").

First response was by bot which said: Disqus will be back tomorrow. Okay-okay, it was sunday, there's no hurry and etc.

11th of January, Monday. I've got response from human:

> Could you please provide us the Disqus shortname you've used to register your site or a direct link to a page on your site where the Disqus embed is installed?

I've answered with my data and kept waiting. Some time after my message got status "seen" and I thought that result is near. I didn't know if any additional info is required for that.
13th and 16th of January I've asked if somebody is in dialog. Because my answer was seen, but no repsonse.

18th of January I've got a response, and try to guess what it was :D

> Could you please provide us the Disqus shortname you've used to register your site or a direct link to a page on your site where the Disqus embed is installed?

Yes! The same one answer as in previous Monday. Why? I don't know. I just answered again with requested shortname, with site and page example where disqus embed exist.
I got "seen" and silence again. 

26th of January, finaly, I've got different answer:

> We've gone ahead and updated your subscription to the non-profit/personal blog free Plus subscription plan. You may now remove ads by clicking the "Start Deactivation" button at the bottom of your Ads Settings page.

Great! But not so good as may be.

## Conclusion

In my case "self-identify" process taken 2 weeks(and some hours). I understand that it's free service and I can't ask for lightning speed. But it looks as simple toggling switch, and making it 2 weeks long... It's very strange.

If it as simple as looks, they can add a button "Self-Identify for free Plus" with some description in settings. And clicking this button will make automatic request with shortname they needed. And then probably e-mail notifications about success/fail. I guess this way will be more fast than current.

But no. Now you need to activate trial, write to support in chat widget, wait for about 2 weeks and check chat sometimes. And yes, this support chat has no any URL, you just need to go to support page, press the request support button and then your chat widget will be loaded with saved conversation. 

That's all my news at this time. Feel free to comment on this page, or visit [this discussion at Github](https://github.com/NEK-RA/nek-ra.github.io/discussions/3) :)
